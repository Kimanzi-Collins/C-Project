## Appendix

This project aims to offer a planner for exam revision.
The system logs the subjects that a student enters, including exam date and difficulty, based on the student.
The system then generates a file for each student and the revision plans.
The system advises on strategies depending on the time left and difficulty.
Although a console version, it's a showcase of a basic project that can be easily learnt.
